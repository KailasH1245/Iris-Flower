# Iris Flower Data Analysis Project

This project is my first data analysis project, where I analyzed the Iris Flower dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

In this project, I performed the following tasks:
- Loaded the Iris dataset from a CSV file
- Explored the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates
- Analyzed the relationships between different features of the Iris flowers
- Created insightful visualizations to represent the data
- Made conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, you need the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
